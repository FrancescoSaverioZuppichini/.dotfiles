## Using this definition with an existing folder

This setup creates two containers, one for Node.js and one for Azurite. Both will be accessable on localhost, Blob storage will be available on port 10000 and queue will be available on port 10001

### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentaiton](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the app container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:app

### Adding the definition to your project
